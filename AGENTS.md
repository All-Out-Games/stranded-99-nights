You will be developing a multiplayer game in a custom scripting language (.csl)

## Networking
> **NEVER USE`Game.is_server()`.** The engine uses client-side prediction with automatic server reconciliation. Gameplay code **must** run on both client and server for smooth behavior.

- All gameplay state is automatically synced. You do not need to write RPCs or manually replicate state.
- The client runs the same gameplay code as the server. The server's authoritative result pushed to the client every 4 frames — you get correctness **and** responsiveness for free.
- Do not forget that **multiple players will be connecting**. Avoid global state that will break with multiple players. Store these as fields on the player.

There are two player methods that control where code runs:
```csl
player.is_local_or_server() {
    // ONLY/MUST used for UI, and all UI must be drawn in player late_update
}

player.is_local() {
    // ONLY used for player specific cosmetic effects like controlling visibility for player specific items. You cannot store any persistent state here, it will be wiped every time the server updates.  
}
```

These are NOT standalone global functions, they must be called from within or on your player class. 

## Imports
All imports go in main.csl (in the /scripts folder) only. You only import folders, not individual scripts.
```csl
// main.csl
import "core:ao"
import "ui" // add folder imports here if needed
```

Find assets with the MCP asset_local_search (query: "tree")
When referencing assets use <path>.<ext>, omit /res from the path. 

Do not use $AO/ui/kit/Icons/sparks/spark_small.png

### Asset Types
```csl
texture := get_asset(Texture_Asset, "ui/button.png");
sound := get_asset(SFX_Asset, "sfx/click.wav");
spine := get_asset(Spine_Asset, "anims/dog/dog.spine");
```

## Entities
Runtime spawned entities:
```csl
e := Scene.create_entity();
e.set_local_position({10, 20});
e.set_local_scale({2.5, 2.5});
e.set_local_rotation(0);
e.set_local_enabled(false);

my_comp := e.add_component(My_Component);
other := e.get_component(Other_Component);

e.destroy();
```

### Iterating Entities
```csl
for entity: entity_iterator() {
}
```

### Iterating Children
visit :: proc(entity: Entity) {
    // logic

    current := entity.get_first_child();
    while current != null {
        visit(current);
        current = current.get_next_sibling();
    }
}

## Components
#### Sprite_Renderer
```csl
sprite := entity.get_component(Sprite_Renderer);
sprite.set_texture(texture);
sprite.color = {1, 1, 1, 1}; // RGBA
sprite.layer = -5;
```

#### Prefab_Asset
```csl
p := get_asset(Prefab_Asset, "MyPrefab.prefab");
entity := instantiate(p);
```

#### Spine_Animator
Reference the Spine skill. If you are asked to make an NPC, shop vendor, or other character, you must use the $AO/streamed_character rig which has useful skins and animations! All streamed_characters need the base/crewchsia skin. 

### Creating Custom Components
> One file per component. You do not need to import them unless they're in a separate folder. 

Lifecycle methods
ao_start
ao_update
ao_late_update
ao_end - when destroyed

```csl
// orbiter.csl
Orbiter :: class : Component {
    // Use `@ao_serialize` to expose a field in the editor (can be modified with the modify_scene mcp tool). Prefer serialized fields, do not look up entities with e.get_name(); 

    follow_entity: Entity @ao_serialize;
    radius: float @ao_serialize;
    speed: float @ao_serialize;
    angle: float;
    
    ao_start :: method() {
        radius = 2.0;
        speed = 1.0;
        angle = 0.0;
    }
    
    ao_update :: method(dt: float) {
        if !#alive(follow_entity) {
            return;
        }
        angle += speed * dt;
        
        offset_x := cos(angle) * radius;
        offset_y := sin(angle) * radius;
        
        center := follow_entity.local_position;
        new_pos := v2{center.x + offset_x, center.y + offset_y};
        entity.set_local_position(new_pos);
    }
}
```
> You can add components you've made to entities in the scene using the modify_scene tool. 

#### Iterating Components
```csl
for player: component_iterator(My_Player) {
}
```

#### Finding components close to the player
```csl
nearby: [..]Enemy;
Scene.get_all_components_in_range(player_pos, 5.0, ref nearby);

closest, found := Scene.get_closest_component_in_range(player_pos, 2.0, Pickup);
```

## Random
```csl
rng: u64 = rng_root_seed();

// Range values are inclusive.
random_float := rng_range_float(ref rng, 0, 1);
random_int := rng_range_int(ref rng, 1, 10);
```

## Strings
```csl
format_string("Value: %", {42});
format_string("health: 100%%");

hp := 67;
// %0 as alias for % when you want either multiple args next to eachother ("%0%") or an arg then a percent literal ("%0%%")
format_string("health: %0%%", {hp}); // health: 67%

// Decimal rounding
format_string("pi: %", {format_float(PI, decimals=2)}); // "pi: 3.14"
```

my_str.count gets length 

## Time
```csl
current_time := get_time(); // Float seconds since game start
frame := get_frame_number(); // u64
```

## SFX
```csl
// Most things that happen in the game should have sound! Find sounds with asset_local_search and asset_remote_search. 
desc := SFX.default_sfx_desc();
desc.entity_to_follow = entity.id; // Always set if the SFX "emits" from a specific entity. 
desc.delay = 0; // For lining up with animations
desc.loop = false;
desc.volume = 0.4;
desc.speed_perturb = 0.1;
desc.specific_to_player = player; // For sounds only one player should hear (UI clicks, coin earning, etc):
sound_id := SFX.play(sound_asset, desc);

SFX.stop(sound_id);
```

## Economy
> Automatically persists currencies (cash, points, etc...)
```csl
Economy.register_currency("Coins", coin_texture_asset);

balance := Economy.get_balance(player, "Coins");

Economy.deposit_currency(player, "Coins", 100);

COST :: 50;
if Economy.can_withdraw_currency(player, "Coins", COST) {
    Economy.withdraw_currency(player, "Coins", COST);
}
```
Any time players receive item or currencies you MUST play a sick animation of the item/coins going up or lerping over and have tactile sfx. 

Round based games should reset economy in player ao_start with Economy.delete_save_data(this)

## UI
- Reference the `UIK` skill for any game UI. Do not mix UIK and UI APIs. 

## Inventory & Items
- When players acquire items (e.g. from a shop or interacting with the world), you MUST use the All Out inventory system documented in the `inventory` skill.
- For placing items in the world use the `inventory-placeable-items` skill. 

## Math Functions
`sin`, `cos`, `pow`, `sqrt`, `lerp`, `clamp`, `abs`, `min`, `max`, `length`, `length_squared`, `normalize` there are no other math functions. 

### Player_Base Reference
- p.is_local_or_server() -> bool // true on the local client and on the server; must only be used for UI. 
- p.is_local() -> bool // true only on the local client; use for purely cosmetic effects (not UI); do not set any persisted state here or it will be wiped. 
- p.get_username()
- p.get_user_id() -> string
- p.avatar_color -> Color_Replace_Color 
- p.device_kind -> .PHONE, .TABLET, .PC 
- p.add_freeze_reason(reason: string)
- p.add_invisibility_reason(reason: string)

## Best Practices
- Do not write your own input. Movement is handled by default (speed = 300). If you need to consume it use player.agent.inputs_this_frame and ability buttons.
- When unsure about an API signature find the appropriate skill. If no results are found you may grep api_references/core/ao/core.csl_engine.
- You MUST fundamentally design your games to account for multiple players. No global tycoons, everything must either be plot based (tycoons) or round based (shooters)
- Brainrots refer to a special class of character you can find by using the get_remote_assets_that_work_well_with tool with catalogId 05604152b758f509 (these are usually collection based games where brainrots obtained in a user defined way generate money over time you can collect by walking up to them when placed in your base)
- All games with plots must have a UIK button to teleport to their own plot.
- Only use the Notifyer API for critical messages there is no other way to convey. Skip notifications if there's a more natural way to convey something.  
- For new-player onboarding use world-space objective arrows insetad of tutorial text. Reference the `world-space-ui` skill and use `Tutorial_Arrow.default_options()` + `Tutorial_Arrow.draw(player, target_position, options)`.
- Any games involving weapons MUST clone https://github.com/All-Out-Games/reusable-weapons-csl.git repo with curl and follow its README. 
- When the prompt requires building a game world do so using the allout MCP scene editing tools instead of scripts. 

### Guidelines for text / copy
- Don't use text in UI if a texture icon would suffice. Players won't spend time reading huge blobs of text.
- If you use text in UI make CERTAIN it fits within its container. UIK does not wrap automatically and you have a tendancy to overflow container bounds. Meticulously check that everything fits with screenshot tests. 
- Don't explain the game with UI/text. Put effort into making the game clear via INTUITIVE GAMEPLAY. 

### Guidelines for maps
- Follow all directions carefully from the world building skill
- Every map must be a large comprehensive game **world**, not a demo. There should be no blue editor backing showing behind anything and the players must have space to explore. 
- Layer 0 is best for most items like towers, world props, trees, etc... since it naturally layers with the player. 

After you make script changes run the All Out MCP compile tool.
Do exactly what the users asks for and nothing more.
